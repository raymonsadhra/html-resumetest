    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>Very disciplined and consistent results-driven student. With 1+ years of experience in retail sales, I possess a creative and strong understanding of how to collaborate, negotiate, multi-task, and lead others. Combining that with my technical skills that revolve around the tech industry I am able to work in team environments that revolve around programming. My expertise in Java and Python allows me to pinpoint technical issues while my sales experience allows me to evolve the workspace into something better. My unbreakable persistence and passion for the tech industry ensure that I am always capable of bringing forth unique ideas to the table. I look forward to seeing how I can help an organization grow alongside myself.
